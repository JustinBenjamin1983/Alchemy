# Financial Due Diligence Checklist

**Analysis Framework with Document Source Mapping**

This checklist maps each financial analysis item to its source document, enabling systematic due diligence. The "Notes / Red Flags" column highlights common warning signs to watch for during your review.

Work through each section systematically. Not all items will be relevant to every transaction—prioritise based on deal size, sector, and specific risk factors identified in initial scoping.

## 1. Profitability & Performance

### 1.1 Margin Analysis

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Gross Margin | Income Statement: Revenue less Cost of Sales/COGS | Declining trend suggests pricing pressure or rising input costs |
| Operating Margin (EBIT) | Income Statement: Operating Income ÷ Revenue | Compare to peers; deterioration may signal cost control issues |
| Net Profit Margin | Income Statement: Net Income ÷ Revenue | Significant gap from operating margin = interest/tax issues |
| EBITDA Margin | Calculate from Income Statement + D&A from Cash Flow Statement | Standard comparability metric; watch for aggressive add-backs |

### 1.2 Return Metrics

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Return on Equity (ROE) | Net Income (I/S) ÷ Avg Shareholders' Equity (B/S) | High ROE from leverage vs operations = different risk profiles |
| Return on Assets (ROA) | Net Income (I/S) ÷ Avg Total Assets (B/S) | Asset-heavy industries naturally lower; compare within sector |
| Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) | NOPAT ÷ Invested Capital (Equity + Net Debt) | Best measure of capital efficiency; compare to WACC |

### 1.3 Revenue Quality

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Recurring vs One-Off Revenue | Notes to Accounts: Revenue Recognition policies; Segment reporting | High one-off revenue inflates current period, understates risk |
| Customer Concentration | Notes to Accounts: Related Party Transactions; Segment Note | >20% from single customer = key-man risk; affects valuation |
| Geographic Concentration | Segment Reporting Note; Management Discussion | Single-market dependency creates regulatory/FX exposure |
| Contract Backlog/Pipeline | Management Discussion; Order Book disclosures | Forward visibility; compare to historical conversion rates |

## 2. Liquidity & Solvency

### 2.1 Short-Term Liquidity

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |

| Current Ratio | Balance Sheet: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities | <1.0 signals potential distress; sector norms vary widely |
| Quick Ratio (Acid Test) | B/S: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities | Strips out illiquid inventory; critical for manufacturing |
| Cash Ratio | B/S: Cash & Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities | Most conservative; important for volatile businesses |
| Net Working Capital | B/S: Current Assets - Current Liabilities | Negative NWC acceptable in some models (e.g., retail float) |

### 2.2 Leverage & Debt Service

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio | B/S: Total Debt ÷ Shareholders' Equity | Industry dependent; rising trend without revenue growth = concern |
| Net Debt / EBITDA | B/S (Net Debt) + I/S (EBITDA calculation) | Standard covenant metric; >3.5x often triggers concerns |
| Interest Coverage (EBIT/Interest) | I/S: Operating Income ÷ Interest Expense | <2.0x is distressed territory; check covenant thresholds |
| Debt Maturity Profile | Notes to Accounts: Borrowings Note; Debt Schedule | Wall of maturities = refinancing risk; check covenant terms |
| Covenant Compliance | Notes to Accounts; Loan Agreements in VDR | Current headroom and historical breaches/waivers |

| Cash Conversion Cycle | B/S: (DSO + DIO - DPO) using receivables, inventory, payables | Lengthening cycle = cash trapped in operations |
| Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) | B/S: (Receivables ÷ Revenue) × 365 | Rising DSO may indicate collection issues or channel stuffing |
| Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) | B/S: (Inventory ÷ COGS) × 365 | Rising DIO signals obsolescence risk or demand drop |
| Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) | B/S: (Payables ÷ COGS) × 365 | Extending beyond industry norm may signal supplier distress |

### 3.2 Free Cash Flow & Capital Allocation

| Analysis Item | Where to Find It | Notes / Red Flags |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Free Cash Flow (FCF) | CFS: Operating Cash Flow - CapEx (Investing Section) | Negative FCF with positive NI = red flag; understand why |
| CapEx: Maintenance vs Growth | CFS Investing Section + Notes: PPE reconciliation | Underspending maintenance = asset quality erosion |
| FCF Yield | FCF ÷ Enterprise Value (or Market Cap) | Compare to peers; indicates cash generation efficiency |
| Dividend Coverage | CFS: OCF ÷ Dividends Paid (Financing Section) | <1.0x = dividends funded by debt or asset sales |
