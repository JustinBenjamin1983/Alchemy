# BEE Analysis Section
bee_analysis:
  sector_threshold: 26%
  sector_code: "Generic B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice (2013, amended 2019)"
  notes: "Financial Services Charter requires 25% for banks/insurers - see FS-specific category"

  trigger_events:
    - Security package requires pledge of BEE shareholder shares
    - Loan covenants include BEE status maintenance requirements
    - Default triggers tied to loss of BEE status/contracts
    - Lender enforcement could transfer BEE shares to non-BEE parties
    - Debt-to-equity conversion diluting BEE shareholders
    - Change of control provisions triggered by BEE ownership shifts

  key_questions:
    - question: "Are any BEE shares pledged as security for existing facilities?"
      why_critical: "Enforcement could inadvertently transfer ownership to non-BEE lenders"
      red_flag_if: "BEE shares form part of security package without anti-dilution protections"

    - question: "Do loan covenants require maintenance of minimum BEE ownership levels?"
      why_critical: "Breach could trigger cross-defaults across multiple facilities"
      red_flag_if: "BEE covenant threshold exceeds current ownership by less than 5% buffer"

    - question: "Does the facility include debt-to-equity conversion rights?"
      why_critical: "Conversion could dilute BEE shareholders below threshold"
      red_flag_if: "Full conversion would reduce BEE ownership below 26%"

    - question: "Are there material contracts with BEE clauses that could be terminated on covenant breach?"
      why_critical: "Loss of key contracts may cascade beyond the financing itself"
      red_flag_if: "Revenue from BEE-contingent contracts exceeds 30% of turnover"

    - question: "What is the voting structure during any standstill or enforcement period?"
      why_critical: "Lender control may affect exercisable voting rights calculation under Codes"
      red_flag_if: "Lender step-in rights include board appointment or voting direction"

  dilution_scenarios:
    - scenario: "Debt-to-equity conversion by non-BEE lender"
      calculation: "Post-conversion BEE % = (Current BEE shares) / (Current shares + Conversion shares)"
      threshold_breach_risk: "High"

    - scenario: "Enforcement on pledged BEE shares"
      calculation: "Post-enforcement BEE % = (Remaining unpledged BEE shares) / (Total shares)"
      threshold_breach_risk: "High"

    - scenario: "New equity raise to cure covenant breach"
      calculation: "If BEE shareholders dont follow: diluted % = (BEE shares) / (Total + New shares)"
      threshold_breach_risk: "Medium"

  contract_clauses_to_check:
    - "BEE warranty and undertaking clauses in facility agreements"
    - "Events of default tied to BEE status changes"
    - "Change of control definitions (whether BEE ownership shift triggers)"
    - "Security documents - restrictions on transfer of pledged BEE shares"
