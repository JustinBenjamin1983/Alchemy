# COT QUESTIONS - WARRANTY & INDEMNITY ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================

cot_questions_warranty_indemnity:
  warranties_analysis:
    - What title and capacity risks exist that require warranty protection (share ownership, encumbrances, authority)?
    - What regulatory and licensing risks require warranty coverage (FSP validity, fit and proper, licence conditions)?
    - What capital adequacy and solvency risks need warranty protection (CAR, SCR, liquidity)?
    - What conduct and TCF risks require warranty coverage (customer complaints, product governance, conflicts)?
    - What AML/CFT risks need warranty protection (RMCP adequacy, KYC compliance, STR reporting)?
    - What insurance-specific risks require warranty coverage (reserves, reinsurance, claims experience)?
    - What financial statement issues require warranty protection (AFS accuracy, undisclosed liabilities, debt disclosure)?
    - What employment issues require warranty protection (employee disclosure, labour compliance, key individuals)?
    - What tax issues require warranty coverage (returns filed, taxes paid, VAT on financial services)?
    - What litigation risks require warranty coverage (pending claims, FAIS Ombud, class actions)?
    - For each identified warranty, what is the appropriate cap and survival period?
    - Which warranties should be fundamental (longer survival, higher/no cap)?

  indemnities_analysis:
    - Based on DD findings, what specific risks require indemnity protection rather than just warranty?
    - What regulatory penalty exposure exists and does it warrant a regulatory indemnity?
    - Is there evidence of mis-selling or TCF failure requiring a customer remediation indemnity?
    - What is the capital adequacy position — does it warrant a capital shortfall indemnity?
    - What is the insurance reserve position — is a reserve deficiency indemnity needed (calculate gap)?
    - What are the FIC findings — does AML/CFT non-compliance warrant a specific indemnity?
    - What is the cybersecurity posture — are data breach indemnities required?
    - What is the tax audit history — are specific tax indemnities required?
    - Are there pending regulatory proceedings that warrant specific indemnities?
    - For each indemnity, what is the appropriate cap, survival period, and basket/deductible?
    - Should escrow be recommended for regulatory or capital-related indemnities?
    - What indemnities should be uncapped or have extended survival?

  warranty_indemnity_structuring:
    - What aggregate warranty cap is appropriate for this transaction (typically 20-50% of purchase price)?
    - What mini-basket and basket thresholds are appropriate (typically 0.1% and 1% of purchase price)?
    - Which warranties should be carved out from limitations (title, capacity, tax, regulatory, fraud)?
    - What is the appropriate general warranty survival period (typically 18-36 months)?
    - Which warranties require extended survival (regulatory 5 years, tax 5 years, title 5+ years)?
    - Should W&I insurance be recommended and what implications does this have for scope?
    - What disclosure mechanism is appropriate (data room deemed disclosure vs specific schedule)?
    - How should indemnities interact with purchase price adjustments (no double recovery)?
    - Are any indemnities time-limited (e.g., capital indemnity until next PA assessment)?
