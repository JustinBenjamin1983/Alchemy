      Generate warranties based on DD findings in the ip_technology transaction context.
      Focus on IP ownership chain, infringement risk, open source compliance, data protection,
      and cybersecurity matters. Each warranty should be traceable to a specific DD finding.
      Fundamental warranties should cover title, IP ownership, and major IP representations.

      Generate indemnities based on specific identified risks in the DD findings.
      Indemnities should be risk-specific and traceable to DD findings.
      Consider whether escrow or holdback is appropriate for each identified risk.
      IP infringement, open source contamination, and data breach indemnities are
      particularly important in IP/technology transactions.
      Quantify exposure where possible based on potential claim values.
