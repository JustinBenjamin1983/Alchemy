  warranties_analysis:
    - What title and capacity risks exist that require warranty protection (share ownership, encumbrances, authority)?
    - What mining right issues require warranty coverage (validity, good standing, SLP, MWP, DMRE compliance)?
    - What Mining Charter/BEE risks need warranty protection (HDSA ownership, fronting, meaningful participation)?
    - What environmental issues require warranty coverage (EMPr, WUL, rehabilitation provision, contamination, TSF)?
    - What financial statement issues require warranty protection (AFS accuracy, undisclosed liabilities, debt disclosure)?
    - What material contract risks need warranty coverage (disclosure, validity, breaches, CoC consents)?
    - What employment issues require warranty protection (employee disclosure, labour compliance, MHSA, unions)?
    - What tax issues require warranty coverage (returns filed, taxes paid, royalties, disputes)?
    - What property and surface rights issues require warranty protection (coverage, servitudes, land claims)?
    - What litigation risks require warranty coverage (pending claims, silicosis, occupational disease)?
    - For each identified warranty, what is the appropriate cap and survival period?
    - Which warranties should be fundamental (longer survival, higher/no cap)?

  indemnities_analysis:
    - Based on DD findings, what specific risks require indemnity protection rather than just warranty?
    - What is the rehabilitation liability gap and does it warrant an indemnity (calculate estimated liability - provision)?
    - Is there evidence of environmental contamination requiring a pre-closing contamination indemnity?
    - What is the TSF stability assessment - does it warrant a specific TSF indemnity?
    - What are the SLP arrears and do they warrant an SLP catch-up indemnity (quantify the catch-up cost)?
    - Are there DMRE compliance issues that warrant a regulatory enforcement indemnity?
    - What is the occupational disease history - are silicosis/TB indemnities required?
    - What is the tax audit history - are specific tax indemnities required beyond general pre-closing tax indemnity?
    - Are there pre-closing breaches of material contracts that warrant termination indemnities?
    - For each indemnity, what is the appropriate cap, survival period, and basket/deductible?
    - Should escrow be recommended for environmental or other critical indemnities (typically 10-20% of price)?
    - What indemnities should be uncapped or have extended survival (environmental, tax, occupational disease)?

  warranty_indemnity_structuring:
    - What aggregate warranty cap is appropriate for this transaction (typically 20-50% of purchase price)?
    - What mini-basket and basket thresholds are appropriate (typically 0.1% and 1% of purchase price)?
    - Which warranties should be carved out from limitations (title, capacity, tax, fraud)?
    - What is the appropriate general warranty survival period (typically 18-36 months)?
    - Which warranties require extended survival (environmental 5-7 years, tax 5 years, title 5+ years)?
    - Should W&I insurance be recommended and what implications does this have for warranty/indemnity scope?
    - What disclosure mechanism is appropriate (data room deemed disclosure vs specific disclosure schedule)?
    - Are any indemnities time-limited (e.g., SLP indemnity until compliance achieved)?
    - How should indemnities interact with purchase price adjustments (no double recovery)?
