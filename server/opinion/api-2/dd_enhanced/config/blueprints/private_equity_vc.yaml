# COT QUESTIONS - WARRANTY & INDEMNITY ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================

cot_questions_warranty_indemnity:
  warranties_analysis:
    - What title and capacity risks exist (share ownership, cap table accuracy, undisclosed equity interests)?
    - What IP ownership risks require warranty protection (chain of title, founder assignments, open source)?
    - What business and commercial risks need warranty coverage (material contracts, CoC provisions, DD accuracy)?
    - What financial risks require warranty protection (AFS accuracy, undisclosed liabilities, projections)?
    - What employment risks need warranty coverage (key persons, restraints, option scheme)?
    - What tax risks require warranty protection (returns, Section 8C, disputes)?
    - What litigation risks need warranty coverage (pending claims, shareholder disputes)?
    - For each warranty, what is the appropriate cap and survival period?
    - Which warranties should be fundamental (title, cap table, IP, fraud)?

  indemnities_analysis:
    - What IP ownership gaps require indemnity protection beyond warranties?
    - Is there open source contamination risk requiring a specific indemnity?
    - What founder-related risks warrant specific indemnities (restraint breach, pre-investment conduct)?
    - What pre-investment tax liabilities require indemnity coverage?
    - Are there undisclosed matters that warrant unlimited indemnity protection?
    - For each indemnity, what cap, survival period, and basket apply?
    - Should escrow be recommended for critical indemnities?

  warranty_indemnity_structuring:
    - What aggregate warranty cap is appropriate (typically 20-50% of investment amount)?
    - What mini-basket and basket thresholds apply (typically 0.1% and 1%)?
    - Which warranties should be carved out from limitations (title, cap table, IP, tax, fraud)?
    - Should W&I insurance be recommended for this transaction?
    - How do warranties interact with the investment agreement's representations?
    - What is appropriate survival (general 18-24 months, fundamental 3-5 years, tax 5 years)?
