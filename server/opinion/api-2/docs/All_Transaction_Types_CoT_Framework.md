# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework
## All Transaction Types - Attorney Review Document

**Purpose:** This document consolidates the Chain-of-Thought reasoning questions for ALL transaction types in the DD system. Please review each section and add, modify, or remove questions as appropriate.

**How CoT Works:** For each finding, the AI must answer these reasoning questions BEFORE classifying severity and deal impact. This ensures transparent, auditable analysis.

---

## Universal 6-Step Reasoning Framework

For EVERY finding across ALL transaction types, the AI completes these steps:

| Step | Question | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1. IDENTIFICATION | What specific clause or provision triggers concern? Quote exact text. | Ensure finding is grounded in document evidence |
| 2. CONTEXT | What is the commercial significance of this document/contract? | Assess materiality |
| 3. TRANSACTION IMPACT | How does this interact with CoC / share sale? Does it trigger the provision? | Understand whether issue is activated |
| 4. SEVERITY REASONING | Why critical/high/medium/low? What's the worst case? | Justify severity classification |
| 5. DEAL IMPACT REASONING | Why blocker vs CP vs price chip? Can it be resolved? | Justify deal impact classification |
| 6. FINANCIAL QUANTIFICATION | Calculate specific exposure. Show all working. | Provide actionable numbers |
