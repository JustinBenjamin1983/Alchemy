---

## Section 4: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Integration

### 4.1 What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?

Chain-of-Thought prompting requires the AI to explicitly reason through each step before reaching a conclusion. Instead of jumping directly to "This is a deal blocker," the AI must show:

1. **What** it identified
2. **Why** it matters for this transaction
3. **How** it calculated any exposure
4. **Therefore** what classification applies

### 4.2 Proposed CoT Reasoning Framework

For each potential finding, the AI must complete these reasoning steps **IN ORDER** before classifying:

#### Step 1: IDENTIFICATION
- What specific clause or provision triggers concern?
- Quote the exact language from the document

#### Step 2: CONTEXT
- What is the surrounding contractual context?
- What type of document is this? (critical contract, standard agreement, etc.)
- What is the commercial significance?

#### Step 3: TRANSACTION IMPACT ANALYSIS
- How does this interact with a 100% share sale / change of control?
- Does the transaction trigger this provision?
- What are the consequences if triggered?

#### Step 4: SEVERITY REASONING
- Why is this critical/high/medium/low?
- What is the worst-case scenario?
- What is the likelihood of that scenario?

#### Step 5: DEAL IMPACT CLASSIFICATION
- Why is this a blocker vs. condition vs. price chip?
- Can it be resolved before closing?
- Who needs to act (buyer/seller/third party)?

#### Step 6: FINANCIAL QUANTIFICATION
- Can a specific exposure be calculated?
- Show all working (e.g., "24 months × R3.2M/month = R76.8M")
- What assumptions are being made?

### 4.3 Example: Without CoT vs. With CoT

#### Example Document Text:
> "Clause 15.2: In the event of a Change of Control of the Lessee, the Lessor may terminate this Lease Agreement upon 90 days written notice. The Lessee shall be liable for payment of an amount equal to 24 months' rental as liquidated damages. Current monthly rental: R3,200,000."

---

#### WITHOUT Chain-of-Thought:

```json
{
  "finding_id": "F001",
  "category": "change_of_control",
  "description": "Lease contains CoC termination right with liquidated damages",
  "severity": "critical",
  "deal_impact": "condition_precedent",
  "financial_exposure": {
    "amount": 76800000,
    "currency": "ZAR"
  }
}
```

**Problem:** No reasoning shown. How do we know the classification is correct?

---

#### WITH Chain-of-Thought:

```json
{
  "finding_id": "F001",
  "category": "change_of_control",

  "reasoning": {
    "step_1_identification": "Clause 15.2 contains a Change of Control provision granting the Lessor a termination right. Exact text: 'In the event of a Change of Control of the Lessee, the Lessor may terminate...'",

    "step_2_context": "This is the Surface Lease Agreement for the mining area. Without this lease, the company cannot access the land required for mining operations. The lease covers the primary mining pit and processing plant area.",

    "step_3_transaction_impact": "A 100% share sale constitutes a Change of Control under standard definitions. This will trigger Clause 15.2. The Lessor has discretion ('may terminate') - this is not automatic termination.",

    "step_4_severity_reasoning": "CRITICAL because: (1) Loss of surface access would halt all mining operations; (2) The mining right is worthless without surface access; (3) There is no alternative site available. However, the Lessor has discretion, not obligation, to terminate.",

    "step_5_deal_impact_reasoning": "CONDITION PRECEDENT (not deal blocker) because: (1) Lessor consent is obtainable - they have commercial incentive to continue receiving rent; (2) The provision is discretionary; (3) Engagement with Lessor should occur pre-signing to gauge willingness. If Lessor indicates unwillingness to consent, this escalates to DEAL BLOCKER.",

    "step_6_financial_quantification": "Liquidated damages calculation: 24 months × R3,200,000 per month = R76,800,000. This represents the maximum exposure if Lessor terminates and enforces liquidated damages. Additional exposure: loss of mining operations during any relocation period (not quantifiable without further analysis)."
  },

  "description": "Surface Lease contains Change of Control termination right with R76.8M liquidated damages exposure. Lessor consent required as condition precedent.",
  "clause_reference": "Clause 15.2",
  "evidence_quote": "In the event of a Change of Control of the Lessee, the Lessor may terminate this Lease Agreement upon 90 days written notice.",
  "severity": "critical",
  "deal_impact": "condition_precedent",
  "financial_exposure": {
    "amount": 76800000,

    "calculation": "24 months × R3,200,000/month = R76,800,000",
    "type": "liquidated_damages"
  },
  "action_required": "Engage with Lessor pre-signing to obtain consent or waiver of termination right. If consent not forthcoming, escalate to deal blocker.",
  "responsible_party": "seller",
  "deadline": "Prior to signing SPA"
}
```

### 4.5 Implementation in the System

The CoT framework will be implemented by modifying:

1. **System Prompt** - Adding the reasoning methodology requirements
2. **Analysis Prompt** - Adding the step-by-step reasoning structure
3. **JSON Output Schema** - Adding the `reasoning` object to capture each step

This ensures:
- Every finding shows its working
- Classification errors are visible and correctable
- Attorneys can validate the AI's logic
- Training data can be generated for improvement

   - Should any priority levels be changed?
   - Are there transaction-specific documents that should be added?

2. **Analysis Questions (Section 2)**
   - Are the current questions comprehensive?
   - What questions should be added for each risk category?
   - Are there questions that are rarely relevant and could be removed?

3. **Deal Blocker Definitions (Section 3)**
   - Are the deal blocker definitions appropriate?
   - Should any be added or modified?
   - What is the threshold for "material" third-party consent?

4. **CoT Reasoning Framework (Section 4)**
   - Is the 6-step reasoning framework appropriate?
   - Should any steps be added, removed, or modified?
   - Are the category-specific questions comprehensive?

5. **Real-World Validation**
   - Can we test this against a recent transaction?
